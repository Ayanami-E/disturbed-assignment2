Client.py Enhancements:
"In the client-side logic, I utilize the requests library for making remote procedure calls to our server, embodying Heterogeneity by ensuring that different components of our system can interoperate seamlessly, regardless of the underlying technologies. This RPC abstraction allows users to interact with our application as if they were making local function calls. In aligning with Openness, our client design is modular, enabling easy integration or replacement of components without affecting the overall system functionality. To address Security, the client implements robust validation and error handling to ensure that interactions are authorized and intended. Additionally, in terms of Scalability, our client architecture is designed to efficiently handle a growing number of requests without degradation in performance. Failure handling is also a critical component; if, for example, a network issue arises while adding a note, our client logic catches the exception and provides immediate feedback, preventing one component's failure from affecting the system's overall functionality. Lastly, we ensure Transparency; despite the distributed nature of these processes, to the end-user, all operations appear local and seamless."

Service.py Features:
"On the server side, our application acts as the cornerstone of Heterogeneity, by integrating with various data formats and protocols, particularly demonstrated through our interaction with the Wikipedia API. We've constructed our system with an emphasis on Openness, allowing for the easy addition of new features or services. Regarding Security, we implement strict access controls and data validation to safeguard our information. In response to the design challenge of Scalability, the server is built to efficiently manage an increasing load, thus ensuring reliability and speed as the user base expands. Failure handling is evident in how the system manages errors, such as when an API call fails; instead of causing a system-wide outage, the error is logged and managed locally, ensuring consistent service availability. Furthermore, Transparency is maintained as we hide the complexity of the distributed interactions from the user, offering a unified and straightforward interface."

Test.py Strategy:
"Our testing framework in test.py addresses Scalability by employing ThreadPoolExecutor for simulating concurrent remote procedure calls, crucial for evaluating the system's performance under load. It aligns with Heterogeneity, as it tests the system's ability to handle a variety of request types simultaneously. The built-in feedback mechanism demonstrates our commitment to Failure handling, as it allows us to promptly detect, diagnose, and address issues as they arise. This approach ensures that failures in individual tests do not compromise the overall system integrity. Moreover, this testing simulates real-world scenarios to ensure that our system remains Transparent to users, maintaining a seamless experience even under stress. Through rigorous testing, we also ensure that the system remains Secure and Open for future extensions and improvements, thus meeting our design challenges head-on."
